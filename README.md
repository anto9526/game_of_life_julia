In this project i have made a simple game of life simulation to familiarize myself a bit with Juila.

Rules to the game of life:

If a cell is filled it is alive.

If a living cell is surrounded by 2 or 3 living cells it survives else it dies.

If a dead cell is surrounded by 3 living cells it is given life.
